# Infinite Clones

Infinite Clones disables Scratch's 300 clone limit.
(You can change this limit in the link by changing the clones=Infinity to any value)
:::caution
Some projects assume that Scratch will prevent it from creating more clones at some point. These projects may break with this option enabled.
